Calculated Field
: A new field created in Tableau using a formula based on existing data. Calculated fields allow you to perform computations, manipulate strings, apply logic, and aggregate data to generate new insights that aren't directly present in your original dataset.

Continuous
: In Tableau, a field that represents an unbroken range of values, typically numbers or dates. Continuous fields usually create axes in a visualization and are represented by green pills.

Dashboard
: A canvas in Tableau where you combine multiple worksheets (charts) and other visual elements into a single interactive view. Dashboards allow users to compare different perspectives of data and apply filters across multiple charts simultaneously.

Dimension
: In Tableau, a qualitative field that contains categorical data (e.g., names, dates, geographic data, IDs). Dimensions are used to categorize, segment, and reveal details in your data. They typically create headers in a visualization and are represented by blue pills.

Discrete
: In Tableau, a field that represents distinct, separate values or categories. Discrete fields usually create headers in a visualization and are represented by blue pills.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
: An iterative process of analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often using visual methods. EDA helps you understand your data, detect outliers, discover patterns, and formulate hypotheses.

Measure
: In Tableau, a quantitative field that can be aggregated (e.g., sums, averages, counts). Measures are values that you can perform mathematical operations on. They typically create axes in a visualization and are represented by green pills.

Pages Shelf
: A shelf in Tableau that allows you to break a view into a sequence of pages based on the individual members of a dimension or measure. This is commonly used to create animations over time, with each "page" representing a different step or time period.

Tableau Public
: A free version of Tableau Desktop that allows users to create and explore visualizations. Workbooks created in Tableau Public are primarily designed to be saved to a public online profile, making them accessible to anyone on the web.

Visus
: A colloquial term used in the Tableau community to refer to individual visualizations or charts.

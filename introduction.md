## What is Tableau?

Tableau is a data visualization platform that enables users to explore and communicate data effectively through interactive charts, dashboards, and maps. It’s widely used across many fields, including business, public policy, and research.

## Tableau Public vs. Tableau Desktop

There are two main versions of Tableau:

- **Tableau Public** is a free version that lets you create visualizations and publish them to a public web profile. It’s ideal for learning, sharing, and non-sensitive data.
- **Tableau Desktop** is the full version available through paid licenses or free academic access for students. It includes additional features like saving locally and connecting to a broader range of data sources.

:::: callout

As of version 2025.1.2, Tableau Public supports local saves. However, all visualizations are still published to your public Tableau profile unless you explicitly choose to save them offline.

## Launching Tableau and Connecting to Data

To get started, if Tableau Desktop (or Public) is in your dock, you can click it open. However, a standard method is to navigate to your Applications folder (or wherever you installed it) and launch it from there.

Once Tableau  is open:

1. Under **Connect**, click **Text File**.
2. Browse to your downloaded CSV file and select it.
3. Tableau will show a preview of the data. Click **Sheet 1** to begin working.

::: keypoints
- Tableau helps you explore and present data using interactive visualizations.
- Tableau Public is free and great for learning, but saves work to the web.
- Tableau Desktop provides additional functionality and is free for students.
- Use well-formatted CSVs to start quickly.
